# Image-Enhancement-Histogram-Modi-cation

# Description
1. Histogram\
Compute and plot the image's histogram pr(r) and cdf cr(r).
2. cdf\
Apply gamma correction, give images and associated histograms and cdf's for gamma = 5:0 and gamma = 0:20.\
3. Contrast Stretching\
Apply the following histogram-modification procedure to the original image:\
(a)Set all pixels with gray levels below 10% in the cdf to black.\
(b)Set all pixels with gray levels above 90% in the cdf to white.\
(c)Linearly stretch the range between the 10% and 90% gray levels to cover the range 0 to 255.\
 Give the modi ed image and its new histogram and cdf.\
 4. HE\
 Equalize the original image using H.
 i. Plots=T(r) for this situation, where 0<=r<=255 and 0<=s<=255.\
 ii. Give the equalized image along with its histogram and cdf.
